    "# **SIAM UQ24 MT5: PyDMD - Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract:** PyDMD is a Python package designed for Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a data-driven method used for analyzing and extracting spatiotemporal coherent structures from time-varying datasets. The package implements many extensions to handle noisy data, impose structure on the learned operators, and provide uncertainty estimates. PyDMD has a comprehensive and user-friendly interface, making it a valuable tool for researchers, engineers, and data scientists working in various fields. After this mini tutorial, participants will be able to use all the main functionalities of the package, exploit Bagging-Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition (BOP-DMD) for uncertainty quantification, and develop new DMD classes."
