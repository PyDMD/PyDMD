# ## Developers Tutorial 1: Extending PyDMD

# Contrary to other **PyDMD** tutorials, this notebook illustrates the general structure of the basic classes, aiming to help developers to <u>extend</u> the package functionality in a smooth way.
#
# In this tutorial we will indeed create from scratch a new version of the original DMD; such extension will be totally useless from a scientific perspective, the only purpose is showing the suggested steps to implement new variants inside **PyDMD**.

# The necessary bricks for building the new DMD version are:
#
# - [`DMDBase`](https://mathlab.github.io/PyDMD/dmdbase.html), the actual backbone of all the different implemented versions;
# - `DMDTimeDict`, the class that manages the time window;
# - `DMDOperator`, the class that manages the so-called DMD operator;
#
# We start the new module by importing all these classes and the usual math environment (`matplotlib`+`numpy`).

# We are now able to create a new class inheriting from `DMDBase`: in this way we just need to implement the new `fit()` method. We can also overload one or more attributes/methods, depending on the algorithm which we are going to follow.
#
# In this case, we also overload the constructor (i.e. the `__init__` method) to present a non-trivial case.
#
# ### Our simple algorithm
# The new functionality we are going to implement is basically a simple DMD which maps the input snapshots using a custom function, provided by the user before of the construction of the operator.
#
# Since the (quite) high number of parameters in the constructor, we suggest to pass explicitly all of them instead of using `args` and `kwargs`. It's redundant, but also much more readable! We can call the `DMDBase` constructor thanks to `super` keyword (more info on `super` [here](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/functions.html?highlight=super#super)).

# Reconstruction looks fine! We are able to note that, since the normalization of the snapshots, the two approaches returns similar results, just a bit rescaled, that is what we expected by preprocessing in this way the input data.
#
# But what about if we want to rescale back the reconstruction (or the modes) in the new version?
# Simple, we have just to overload the `reconstructed_data` or `modes` attributes.
#
# This is the basic guide to implement a new version of DMD. For more complex changes to the algorithm, we recommend to carefully read the documentation of the package, and maybe reporting in the [Github issues page](https://github.com/mathLab/PyDMD/issues) the extension you are going to implement.
