Python Dynamic Mode Decomposition.


Description
--------------------
PyDMD PyDMD is a Python package designed for Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a data-driven method used for analyzing and extracting spatiotemporal coherent structures from time-varying datasets. It provides a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for performing DMD analysis, making it a valuable tool for researchers, engineers, and data scientists working in various fields.

With PyDMD, users can easily decompose complex, high-dimensional datasets into a set of coherent spatial and temporal modes, capturing the underlying dynamics and extracting important features. The package implements both standard DMD algorithms and advanced variations, enabling users to choose the most suitable method for their specific needs. These extensions allow to deal with noisy data, big dataset, control variables, or to impose physical structures.

PyDMD offers a seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem, leveraging popular libraries such as NumPy and SciPy for efficient numerical computations and data manipulation. It also offers a variety of visualization tools, including mode reconstruction, energy spectrum analysis, and time evolution plotting. These capabilities enable users to gain insights into the dominant modes of the system, identify significant features, and understand the temporal evolution of the dynamics.

PyDMD promotes ease of use and customization, providing a well-documented API with intuitive function names and clear parameter descriptions. The package is actively maintained and updated, ensuring compatibility with the latest Python versions and incorporating user feedback to improve functionality and performance. We provide many tutorials showing the characteristics of the software.

Installation
--------------------
PyDMD requires requires numpy, scipy, matplotlib, future, sphinx (for the documentation) and pytest (for local test). The code is tested for Python 3, while compatibility of Python 2 is not guaranteed anymore. It can be installed using pip or directly from the source code.

Installing via PIP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PyDMD is available on PyPI, therefore you can install the latest released version with:
::

    pip install pydmd

To uninstall the package:
::

    pip uninstall pydmd


Installing from source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The official distribution is on GitHub, and you can clone the repository using
::

    git clone https://github.com/PyDMD/PyDMD

To install the package just type:
::

    pip install -e .

Funding
--------------------
A significant part of PyDMD has been written either as a by-product for other projects people were funded for, or by people on university-funded positions. There are probably many of such projects that have led to some development of PyDMD. We are very grateful for this support!

Beyond this, PyDMD has also been supported by some dedicated projects that have allowed us to work on extensions, documentation, training and dissemination that would otherwise not have been possible. In particular, we acknowledge the following sources of support with great gratitude: H2020 ERC CoG 2015 AROMA-CFD project 681447 (P.I. Gianluigi Rozza), and the FSE HEaD project Bulbous Bow Shape Optimization through Reduced Order Modelling.
