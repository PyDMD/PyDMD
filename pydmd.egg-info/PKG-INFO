        ## Description
        **PyDMD** is a Python package that uses **Dynamic Mode Decomposition** for a data-driven model simplification based on spatiotemporal coherent structures. 
        
        Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a model reduction algorithm developed by Schmid (see "Dynamic mode decomposition of numerical and experimental data"). Since then has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. DMD relies only on the high-fidelity measurements, like experimental data and numerical simulations, so it is an equation-free algorithm. Its popularity is also due to the fact that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying system. See Kutz ("Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems") for a comprehensive overview of the algorithm and its connections to the Koopman-operator analysis, initiated in Koopman ("Hamiltonian systems and transformation in Hilbert space"), along with examples in computational fluid dynamics.
        
        In the last years many variants arose, such as multiresolution DMD, compressed DMD, forward backward DMD, and higher order DMD among others, in order to deal with noisy data, big dataset, or spurius data for example. 
        
        In PyDMD we implemented the majority of the variants mentioned above with a user friendly interface. See the [**Examples**](#examples) section below and the [**Tutorials**](tutorials/README.md) to have an idea of the potential of this package.
        
        The research in the field is growing both in computational fluid dynamic and in structural mechanics, due to the equation-free nature of the model.
        
        
        
        ## Dependencies and installation
        **PyDMD** requires requires `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `future`, `sphinx` (for the documentation) and `nose` (for local test). The code is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6. It can be installed using `pip` or directly from the source code.
        
        ### Installing via PIP
        Mac and Linux users can install pre-built binary packages using pip.
        To install the package just type: 
        ```bash
        > pip install pydmd
        ```
        To uninstall the package:
        ```bash
        > pip uninstall pydmd
        ```
        
        ### Installing from source
        The official distribution is on GitHub, and you can clone the repository using
        ```bash
        > git clone https://github.com/mathLab/PyDMD
        ```
        
        To install the package just type:
        ```bash
        > python setup.py install
        ```
        
        To uninstall the package you have to rerun the installation and record the installed files in order to remove them:
        
        ```bash
        > python setup.py install --record installed_files.txt
        > cat installed_files.txt | xargs rm -rf
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        **PyDMD** uses [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) for code documentation. You can view the documentation online [here](http://mathlab.github.io/PyDMD/). To build the html version of the docs locally simply:
        
        ```bash
        > cd docs
        > make html
        ```
        
        The generated html can be found in `docs/build/html`. Open up the `index.html` you find there to browse.
        
        
        ## Testing
        
        We are using Travis CI for continuous intergration testing. You can check out the current status [here](https://travis-ci.org/mathLab/PyDMD).
        
        To run tests locally (`nose` is required):
        
        ```bash
        > python test.py
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        You can find useful tutorials on how to use the package in the [tutorials](tutorials/README.md) folder.
        
        Here we show a simple application (taken from [tutorial 2](tutorials/tutorial-2-adv-dmd.ipynb)): we collect few snapshots from a toy system with some noise and reconstruct the entire system evolution.

        ## How to contribute
        We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.
        
        ### Submitting a patch
        
          1. It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or
             feature you're intending to fix.  Even if you think it's relatively minor,
             it's helpful to know what people are working on.  Mention in the initial
             issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can
             be assigned to you.
        
          2. Follow the normal process of [forking][] the project, and setup a new
             branch to work in.  It's important that each group of changes be done in
             separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the
             commits related to that bug or feature.
        
          3. To ensure properly formatted code, please make sure to use 4
             spaces to indent the code. The easy way is to run on your bash the provided
             script: ./code_formatter.sh. You should also run [pylint][] over your code.
             It's not strictly necessary that your code be completely "lint-free",
             but this will help you find common style issues.
        
          4. Any significant changes should almost always be accompanied by tests.  The
             project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing
             tests if you're unsure how to go about it. We're using [coveralls][] that
             is an invaluable tools for seeing which parts of your code aren't being
             exercised by your tests.
        
          5. Do your best to have [well-formed commit messages][] for each change.
             This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit
             messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.
        
          6. Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request][]. Please,
             remember to rebase properly in order to maintain a clean, linear git history.
